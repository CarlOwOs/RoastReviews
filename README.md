## About RoastReviews

Are you a coffee lover? Have you ever traveled to a new city and spent hours on google maps reading reviews to decide where to get a good cup of coffee? With so many options available, knowing which coffee shops are worth your time and money is hard. Yelp reviews can be helpful, but reading through them is time-consuming and overwhelming.

To solve this problem, we have created RoastReviews, a web app that uses AI to analyze reviews for coffee shops and provide ratings on relevant categories. With it we hope to help users save time and reduce confusion when looking for coffee shops in new cities. With the help of AI we can find businesses that match their preferences and help them make the most out of their trips.
